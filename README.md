# IPI C++ Lecture

This repo contains C++ code for the introductory programming lecture „IPI“ at University of Heidelberg during the winter term 2016/2017. The [lecture](https://hciweb.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/teaching/ipi_2016) was given by [Ullrich Köthe](https://hciweb.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/Staff/ukoethe).

- notes: coding examples and small exercises along the lecture
- prepcourse: exercises of the preparatory course
- practice: exam training
